            <h4>Arashiyama Monkey Park Iwatayama</h4>
            <img src="images/monkey1.jpg" alt="">

            <p>The park is located in Arashiyama, one of Kyoto’s busiest tourist areas, and is easily accessible by
                train. It boasts about 120 snow monkeys, which are also called Japanese Macaque. They are native to
                Japan, and, yes, these are the type of monkeys seen in iconic photos in which they’re bathing at hot
                springs in winter.
                <br><br>

                Entering the park, I immediately spotted a monkey scrambling in the tall grass just meters away. I’d not
                seen this animal anywhere but a zoo. At first, being so close was a bit nerve-wracking, but it was also
                refreshing to see these creatures free from a glass cage. The active ones would swing from tree branches
                and run up the mountainside. The hike itself is fairly easy and takes about 30 minutes.<br><br>

                Following the path, at the top is a view of the city, mountains, and river, with a bright blue sky
                draped over it all on a sunny day. After fawning over the view (Japan really hypes up -- and does not
                disappoint -- on that “view”), there is a chance to feed the monkeys.

                They're eager to gobble up apple chunks tourists can buy and offer through the safety of an enclosed
                area. They grab the food right out of your hand, as they hang on the outside of the caged-in window
                area.

                A visit will take about 1-2 hours, and visitors can enter from 9 am–4:30 pm. /5 pm. from 15th March to
                30 September. During the Autumn and Winter periods, the park is open from 9 am–4 pm, while the
                Mountaintop is open from 9 am–4:30 pm
