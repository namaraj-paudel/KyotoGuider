                        <h1>Overview</h1>
                        <p>When foreign residents move to Japan, they often find the garbage disposal system difficult
                            to understand. In other countries, waste is usually divided into three main types:
                            recyclable, domestic, and vegetation. But in Japan, rubbish is split into even smaller
                            subcategories, such as newspapers, periodicals, and plastic, and must be discarded on
                            specific days. Depending on the area, you may be required to use special bags for your
                            trash. To make sure you are following the correct disposal rules, you should consult a
                            pamphlet from your local municipality, which are often available in English and Chinese, or
                            ask someone living in the same area. Knowing the rules of garbage disposal in your
                            neighborhood is essential.</p>

                        <p>While particular garbage separation rules are implemented by each municipality, garbage is
                            divided into four main categories in Japan: burnable, non-burnable, recyclable, and
                            oversized.</p>

                        <p>Most household garbage, including kitchen waste and paper scraps, is classified as burnable
                            garbage.</p> <br>

                        <p>Non-burnable garbage refers to non-recyclable waste, like metal and glass items. A frying pan
                            or glass cup would fall into this category.</p><br>

                        <p>Plastic bottles, container jars, and cans are classified as recyclable garbage.</p><br>

                        <p>Lastly, oversized garbage includes large furniture and home appliances. According to the Home
                            Appliance Recycling Law, air conditioners, TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines are not
                            collected in local municipalities.</p> <br>

                        <p>Residents must pay a recycling fee of between 1,000 and 6,000 yen to dispose of their
                            oversized garbage. You can have it collected by shop staff where the item was purchased, or
                            take the item to a designated pick-up location yourself.</p> <br>

                        <p>Recyclable garbage is further divided into four subcategories. Let's take a look at how
                            recyclable garbage is separated before disposal.</p> <br>
