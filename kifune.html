            <h4>kifune shrine</h4>
            <img src="images/kifune5.jpg" alt="Kiyomizu-dera Temple">

            <p>Kibune is only around thirty minutes from Kyoto City, but it feels like worlds away. If you want to
                escape the hustle and bustle to experience a bit of tranquility and calm, take the Eizan train north.
                The area is filled to the brim with wildlife and seasonal flowers blooming along the river, and the
                local restaurants and ryokan (traditional inns) serve meals on platforms built over the cool waters.
                Kibune is also home to the Kifune Shrine, a shrine that worships kami associated with water. Three
                separate locations make up Kifune Shrine; the main shrine, Yui no Yashiro, and the Okunomiya. Some
                people choose to take a certain course to make this pilgrimage. First visit the main shrine, then after
                you finish praying go straight back to the Okunomiya, then lastly drop by the middle shrine, Yui no
                Yashiro, as you’re heading home. Not only stunning in the summer, Kifune Shrine is absolutely gorgeous
                in winter as well. If you can brave the chilly weather, go to Kibune village when it is snowing and the
                area is covered in a blanket of snow, becoming a dreamy wonderland.
                <br><br>

                The stone staircase lined with red wooden lanterns and covered by a canopy of maples leading up to
                Kifune Shrine’s main hall is a famous sight often photographed in all seasons. This shrine was
                patronized by the Imperial Court in the Heian Period, and during this time the Imperial Court sent
                official delegations to the shrine and offered the deities horses as gifts when praying for certain
                weather; a black horse to ask for rain and a white horse to ask for clear skies. Because of this
                tradition, there are statues of horses at the shrine to this day. Near the main hall is a place to buy
                amulets, as well as a small pool of water to use in fortune telling<br><br>

                At Kifune Shrine, a shrine related to prayers for water, you can enjoy some fortune telling using that
                very medium. The fortune telling sheets of paper are called mizuura mikuji, and you can purchase them at
                the shrine for a small fee. Simply place the sheet of paper in the small basin of water near the main
                hall and wait until your fortune appears on the piece of paper, predicting various aspects of your life
                including love, work, health, and dreams. With time, the water soaks through the paper and begins to
                obscure the fortune, so don’t forget to snap a photo! Even if you don’t speak Japanese, you don’t need
                to worry. There is a small QR code on the omikuji paper that can be scanned with a QR code reader
                application on smartphones. If you scan this code your phone will pull up a page that offers
                translations of the fortune (in English, Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Korean), as well as an audio
                recording of the fortune!
